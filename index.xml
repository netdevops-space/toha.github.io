It should be noted that all these projects are done by people who contribute a lot to their development. So I decided to make a similar list - Awesome Folks, and focus on the people of our community and their projects.
The list will be updated and added to.
If you have a candidate you&amp;rsquo;d like to suggest, or if you yourself would like to be on this list, please email egaripov@netdevops.</description></item></channel></rss>
