You have probably come across the awesome list, where various interesting projects and links to it are published.  It should be noted that all these projects are done by people who contribute a lot to their development.
So I decided to make a similar list - Awesome Folks, and focus on the people of our community and their projects.  

The list will be updated and added to. 

If you have a candidate you'd like to suggest, or if you yourself would like to be on this list, please email egaripov@netdevops.space.
